                <h2>Q.1.2 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites:</h2>
                <p>Copyright is the protection needed to an original creative works, for example music, a website or drama. This may also include any form of creative text, film, graphic, and websites.
                        Constraints affecting a website could be either physical or psychological.
                        
                        
                        A physical constraint could be, path, Axes or Barriers. 
                        Paths constrain the user in a linear fashion. This is usually displayed with a visual groove or channel. The uses of Paths are best implemented when you want to allow users to vary the value of something in small increments. For example, volume controls on music player where there is no way to misuse the control.[1]
                        Axes allow users to vary things in a rotary motion. This has great benefits as it allows users to vary things infinitely yet able to occupy a small space. An example of this would be a rotation tool on a image manipulation program, where the user can rotate an object through 360 degrees based on a axis guiding your movement.[1]
                        Barriers stop, slow down or redirect a users actions. Barriers prevent actions which would hinder the user from successfully completing a task. A prime example of this would be a pop-up box which would say “are you sure you want to perform this action?” which are often found on e-commerce sites where the user is committing to payment.[1]
                        A Psychological constraint could be in terms of ; symbols, conventions, and mapping.
                        Symbols can be in the form of text, icons and/or sounds. Symbols are great way to sort, clarify and warn users about certain actions. An example of this in effect would be the sound a PC makes when an entry is invalid or incomplete. It warns the user that additional actions are necessary to complete a task.[1]
                        Conventions limit the users actions requiring them to use past learnt customs and exercises. An example of this would be a red button placed next to a green button. You do not need to think too much to realise the implications of using one button over the other.[1]
                        Mappings effect the users understanding of the relationship between elements of a particular design. For example, a number of radio buttons placed next to a list of choices implicates a relationship between the two.  Mappings are useful in demonstrating the possible actions of the user based on prominence, position and appearance of the controls.[1]

                    <h2>Q.1.3 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them 
                        </h2>
                    <p> People who are blind may rely on screen readers or a refreshable braille displayed while some may prefer text-based browsers to graphical browser.
                            Some of the barriers they may face are: images that do not have alt text. Videos not described in text or audio. Forms that cannot be tabbed through in a logical sequence or that are poorly labelled. Or even a non standard document format.
                            People with learning difficulties may have difficulties with processing written language or images when read visually, or spoken language when heard, or numbers when read visually or heard. Specific learning disabilities can affect the ability to focus. People with this form of disability may have to rely on getting information through several ways at the same time. For example someone with difficulty reading may use a text to speech approach, while someone with difficulty to understand may use captions to help follow the spoken words or speech. By turning off all animations someone who gets easily distracted may be more able to focus with any distractions.
                            To overcome some of the issues that people with disability may face. The following tools may be used.
                            Alternative keyboards to provide a different method to communicate with the screen for example use of on-screen keyboards, eyegaze keyboard. Also use of a braille and a refreshable braille. The braille technique uses raised dots in various patterns and numbers to that can be read by blind people. 
                            Another means to use websites is a Screen magnifiers. This will be useful for people with low vision by magnifying  portions of the screen for easy viewing.
                            Another means is the screen reader used by anyone blind or has learning disability. This works by interpreting what is displayed on a screen and directed to either a speech synthesis for audio output. 
                            Another is the Sound notification which allows deaf or hard of hearing users to receive visual notification when something is not right.
                            Also a voice recognition can be used by people with some physical disability. Applications that have full keyboard support can be used with voice recognition.
