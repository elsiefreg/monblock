     <h1>Elsie's blog - my Journey in IT</h1>
     <p> I completed a 3 week course in cyber security from code nation. 
         it was a very informative course which I enjoyed and I decided to do
         a follow up by taking the coding course. Eventhough I am more interested 
         in the cyber security area as opposed to coding I believe that it is important 
         to have some coding skills because this could come in handy with a job in cyber security. 
         Also I believe that Code nation has very good instructors that know what they are doing and the company is very 
        interested in the student fufilling thier dreams of becoming part of the IT world.  </p>
