     <h1>Elsie's blog - ME! </h1>
     <p> 
         I am Elsie Fregene, attending code nation a second time for the coding course.
         I live in Manchester and currently not in paid employment because I took time off work to 
         look after my wonderful kids. I have two boys on the autism spectrum and caring for bec has 
         give me a diffderengt propectus of life. I am a now a believer that nothing is impossible all it takes 
         is focus, dedication and commitment to a course you are passionate about.
         I have always been interested in IT because of the endless things that can be done with technology but still yet to be discovered.
         That is the journey I am on. Looking for answers to lots of questions!!!!

     <h2>My Journey</h2>
     <p>  
         I completed a 3 week course in cyber security from code nation. 
         it was a very informative course which I enjoyed and I decided to do
         a follow up by taking the coding course. Eventhough I am more interested 
         in the cyber security area as opposed to coding I believe that it is important 
         to have some coding skills because this could come in handy with a job in cyber security. 
         Also I believe that Code nation has very good instructors that know what they are doing and the company is very 
         interested in the student fufilling thier dreams of becoming part of the IT world. 
         Most of the work that I have done since leaving Uni has been in the IT field and I know this is my Passion.
         One of the greatest satisfaction that I get and why I am in the IT field is because of the thrill you get when you 
         program a machine to do something interesting. For example creating games.
