            <h2>Q.1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of IT in modern business has helped business to move forward beyond how businesses has always
                been conducted in the past. One major impact is that it has allowed business to conduct their task across the global, 
                in various environment at the same time without all parties involved present in the same building and sitting in the same room. 
                The major benefit of that is that a lot can be achieved within a short period. 
                There are also lots of ways now that modern business can carry out their business.

            <h2>Q.1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
                what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
            <p> One key factor needed is the right skill sets that can effectively perform a task in a timely manner. 
               It is important that anyone involved understands the project requirements and how to execute the project to meet its requirement from start to finish of the project. 
               This will include a design of the project detailing what informations are required and what informations will be produced.
               How to convert the design into a code that will be use to generate the project. 
               How will the project be tested and what are the key areas that will be tested and knowing what the outcomes of our testing should be.
               Also needed is a well rounded approach or method that can be used to make sure that all areas are covered and are stored in a central place. 
               Some methods that can be used are a)Trello, b)slack, c)Github 
               The use of Trello will ensure that all information are kept and monitored in a central place that can be easily accessible to all involved in performing the given task. 
               Once this process is completed it can help the project it was designed for to be successfully maintained and enhanced throughout the life cycle of the project.

            <h2> Q.1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. 
                        How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h2>
             <p>To develop a website, the first thing that I will be doing is designing what the Website will be doing. Once this has be decided, 
                    I will now decide the hardware and software that I will be using for the Website and this decision will take into consideration how much I have and how much it will cost to acquire the tools needed. 
                    How big will the memory of the hardware will be and how much expansion on memory can be added in future. 
                    Also I will have to decide stored space and who will be maintaining the website once it is up and running. Once these have been done, 
                    I will now design the steps for the development from the design to the completion of the website. 
                    This will be included on my trello board with each step defined on a card.
                    once a step is been working on I will record it under the doing category and once it is completed will record that step as done under the done category to check off.

            <h2>Q.1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – 
                what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>  
            <p>There are many risks that may impact the completion of a project. I am looking into possible four of these: scheduling, cost, compromise on design, inadequate testing.
               Scheduling risk could impact a project if it is taking longer than anticipated to complete a project and this may be because of some issues beyond the developers control such as not having access to all the modules that are required for the project to be delivered on time.
               One solution to this may be to monitor existing projects development patterns and apply any lessons learnt.
               Cost risk may impact a project completion if the estimation signed off on is inaccurate or poor this will affect the delivery of the product.
               Make sure that the cost is realistic and compare with previous project of the same nature. It may be better to over price by a little margin that under price. Any excess in cost can be kept aside for future enhancements.
               Compromising on design. If adequate time is not spent in the design stage, the developer may end up spending more time than planned on the development and this may end up pushing completion date beyond scheduled time.
               Inadequate testing. If adequate time is not spent on testing, some areas of the project may not be properly tested out and if there are some issues with the product it may affect the deadline. Adequate time must be set out for testing to ensure that all possible scenario are tested for.

            <h2>Q1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – 
                how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
            <p>By researching for a system that can be deplored onto other platforms at easy without major complications. 
                This is important because that way many platforms can access the product. 
                Also consider the long term cost of the software to be used to ensure that we do not run out of licensing nor the specializing host that will host the product if one is decided upon.
                Some of the software that I found will be useful is Trello, Vscode, Slack and Chrome. Trello will be a useful tool for managing the project from start to finish. vscode will be useful for developing the html code. This product has a debugger and it is an easy code builder to use because of the wonderful features of vscode such as the different color code used to identify parts of the code.
                Slack is also a useful tool for communication the scope of the project and was used as a good repository for storing liknks to website that can be used.

            <h2>Q1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – 
                 How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h2>
            <p> This was my first ever exposure to Trello, I found it very useful in that it was very useful in helping us as a team to store all aspect of the project in a central area. 
                This made the project more organized and each member of the team knew exactly what they were doing and were able to sign off on a given task once it has been completed without keeping too many files in different platforms. 
                This makes communication easy amongst the team because we could work from anywhere we could access the software.
                Git and Github was quite helpful because it helped to create a repository for the project and helped in tracking changes made to the code which help with version control of the code knowing which is the current version and also if there was a need to go back to a previous code before any changes were made it was easier to get back to an early version without losing any information.

            <h2>Q1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – 
                How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2> 
            <p>GDPR was passed on the 25 May 2018 which was designed to monitor how individual data on people are stored and used[3].
                The impact this regulations may cause to digital project is that it will limit the types of data that can be stored about an individual now and how it can be used in the future. 
                If a company fails to implement the appropriate security measure needed to protect a data stored about a person’s information they will suffer breach of data. 
                This may cost the company it’s reputation and also huge financial losses.

              <h1>OUTCOME 2:</h1>
         <div class="wrapper">
              <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – 
                  in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
            <p>To build my blog, I used the visual studio editor because it is a code editor that allows the user  to view, edit, 
               run and debug a code. It helps to easily navigate a set of code by saving time. 
               There are lots of built in support available which makes coding easy. 
               This editor works with GITHUB whereby the source control sits on the editor without moving in and out of the editor.
               It is a cross platform product which is can be deplored to any system it is compatable with.
               I used googe docs for writing all my assignement this was very useful because even whike not at the center, 
               I still had access to my documents and could continue at my own time at home. 
               Also we used Trello which was very useful in designing the project.  
               This was used throughout the life cycle of the project from beginning to end and every member of the team 
               had access to the same document and could amend the document.</p >

            <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2>
             <p>For this course we used Visual Studio code to develop and debug our code before executing the codes. 
                Most of the documentation for our project so far has been done using trello because trello gave us the structure
                we needed to detail step by step process that we used in completing the project. 
                It also helped in how we communicated with members of our team and each member was responsible for updating 
                our documenting through Trello. Trello was quite useful because all members of the team could work on it at the same time.  
                Also we used slack for communicating with teams and members of the team.</p>

             <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? 
                     Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
             <p> So far I am happy with my final project because it did achieve what it was set out to do.
                 which is to create a blog about me using html. The blog also talked about my journey in IT and why I am attending a  
                 course in IT. The blog allows its user to navigate through the pages that has been created. 
                 There was much I would have loved to incorporate in the blog but due to time frame and other issues 
                 I was unable to complete all that I had set out to do. One thing I would change was to make sure next time 
                 I have the code editor at home so that I can do more work in my spear time.</p>

        <div class="wrapper">
             <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
            <p>I would like to structure the pages more and have a system that would allow people with learning disability 
                understand the content of the page by adding a text to speech facility and image displayed on the text for visual learners. 
                Also I would havde like to use more colours and diffrent fonts and sizes</p>

            <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
            <p>I was able to create a web page about myself and my Journey using HTML. 
               In my CSS file I would have loved to include more functions than I did and also included more pictures in my website. 
               I would have loved to have created the swebsite in a way that people with disability can access the site especially
               colour blind people this I will have done by using more colours that those group of users can identify with. 
               I would have considered having the website read out by adding a speech access for the vision impaired user.</p>

                    – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
             <p>One benefit of IT tools is that it makes a task easier to complete siuccessfully.  
                It allows users to work from anywhere that they can access the IT from.  
                All data can be stored in a central place so anyone involved with a project has access as long as they have the 
                right permission for the project. One draw back of IT tool is the fear of the wrong person getting access to vital
                and important information that they should noyt have. I could have been more efficient is I had space myself properly 
                and spent motre time on my research than I did.</p>

        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency?</h2> 
            <p>Productivity and efficiency can be improved if adequate time is spent in the research and planned period.
               Also if working in a team everyone being clear of their role and no one person taking more on themselves than everyone else.
               Have regular meet up to go over all aspect of a project that has been completed by reviewing and everyone signing off.  
               Search with members of your group any problems that were encountered along the way to help avoid similiar problems in future 
               Keeping to deadline as much as possible and if there is any problem bring it to the team and not wait till the last minute. 
               Be ready to give assistant to anyone that needs one this helps members feel they are psitively contributing to the project.</p>

                  what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2> 
            <p> The use of slack was very beneficial to the project because of the ease of using it. 
                For team work make sure that each team member has a title and role, 
                for example there should be a spokes person and someone taking notes and writing down minutes at meets.
                Set out frequent times and dates that mdeetings can be held. Provide two possible deadlines to ensure that 
                the the first meeting looks at prototypes of final product.</p>

               Once a module is tested and meets its requirement then sign off that module then test the module with the next step 
               and make sure that they work together if it they do they sign off. 
               Have a test script that contains all expected outcomes and and scenerio. 
               Test script must be based on the design structure.</p>
